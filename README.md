Module 2: Basic Python Concepts
This project demonstrates two beginner-level Python programs:

1. **Perform Basic Mathematical Operations**
2. **Create a Personalized Greeting**

## Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations

This program asks the user to input two numbers and then performs:

- **Addition**
- **Subtraction**
- **Multiplication**
- **Division**

### Example:
```bash
Enter First Number: 10
Enter Second Number: 5
Addition= 15
Subtraction= 5
Multiplication= 50
Division= 2.0

##Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting

This program takes the user's first name and last name as input and prints a personalized greeting message.

Enter your first name: John
Enter your last name: Doe
Hello, John Doe! welcome to the python program.
